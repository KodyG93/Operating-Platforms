# Operating-Platforms

# A brief Summary
We worked in a tech company that created or expanded clients’ services. The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted to expand their game "Draw It or Lose It!" from Android OS to reach a distributed environment where they could have it function on multiple operating systems. They asked us to prepare a Software Design Template to go over our recommendations and have requirements lined out for development. This included things like the design constraints, models, evaluation of the major services, and final recommendations. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I did the evaluation and recommendations verry well. I put a lot of research into them and tried to follow all feedback and make it as comprehensive as possible while maintaining and extreme degree of conciseness. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Knowing the requirements and design constraints was very helpful in adding and adjusting the code that was given. It allowed for flexibility and creativity while accomplishing the goal for the client. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would want to break down the different cloud-based environments and make a specific recommendation for one there. That would be my next revision if the client asked to proceed with a cloud-based environment. Should they decline, I would revise my security section to outline more of what would be needed in a traditional sense.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
First, I read and reread the clients’ desires, once I had a good grasp on them, I then imagined I was a user and how it would feel to move through the game. I made sure to think about what would happen in certain use cases and what I would expect to be my rights as a user or an account holder. This is important because if we do not put ourselves in the users’ shoes and just make a piece of software then it is likely to come across in our design. If you have ever said “that application (or game) was so nicely done” then you know the people put their heart into their work and are proud of what they did. They also think more about the experience for the user and make sure their needs are met. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started by making sure I knew what the client wanted. Then I made sure to know what the user wanted. I then put my heart into it to make something that everyone wanted from the client to the user, and I would be proud of. I made sure to do research and read any assigned materials but look for things outside of the text books. I wanted to see how it works currently and what systems worked right now. I would continue to use the curiosity I had and love for my work to make a great piece of software.
